# cs349
This repo contains `org` source code for my CS349 Principles of Programming Languages assignment.

Please note: this document was originally written with GNU Emacs' `org-mode` editor. 
The source can be viewed in `report.org`.

`org-mode` is superb at a vast range of tasks; I can't recommend it enough. It also serves as a great entry point to Emacs! 
Feel free to shoot me a message if you would like any help.

Will
